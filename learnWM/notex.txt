app.use((req,res,next)=>{

})
    req = store the users data, all the user internal data will be store in 'req' (incoming Data)
    res = which kind of data the user want to send any destination, then use 'res' (Sending Data)
    next = after executing the middleware, we go to the next rout, So to push the code in next rout we use 'next'(Push to next rout)
