*** Before use templete engine we must have a directory, which name is (views).

* view/Templet engine file are : pug,hbs etc
* we use (hbs) replace of html to set dynamic templete.

* to set the view or templete engine -> 
    > at first install (npm i hbs) in the terminal.
    > app.set('view engine', 'hbs')   <= write this code in the current index.js file or any file..
    > app.get("/", (req, res) => {
    res.render('index')
});     <= write this kind of code to execute the hbs file.
 

* In hbs file to declare the vcariable or props we need to use {{}} <<<- this sign, double qurly braces.

* to set the directory name we use = (__dirname)
* console.log(path.join(__dirname,"../public"));  <= This is used to join the current path with public folder/directory..

* const PORT=8000 / 3000
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log("Listining at port 8000");
})      <<= This code is used to call the server or connect with the server..

* to serving the static website in express js >> we use 
             const staticPath = path.join(__dirname, "../public");
this code -> app.use(express.static(staticPath));

* IN app.get("/",(req,res)=>{

})      <= here the first argument always will be a 'request'  <<= This is very importent.

* We can change our templete engine name --> Suppose we write the views fill name as 'assets',
        > then we make a variable :
        const assetsData=path.join(__dirname,"/assets);
    >> Now set the engine route
        app.set("views",assetsData)
